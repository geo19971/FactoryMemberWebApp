For code to work, create new schema in left hand side called thefactory.
Then with that schema import thefactory.sql into it.

There are some example users in there:

User  /  Password

test     test
test2    test           <----- Has Factory Member Access. So can upload products. 

Please note vistually the website is just bootstrapping W3 code. 

This can be changed and modified only after all the core functionality and code has been designed.
